Six Sigma is a data-driven methodology and set of tools used to improve business processes by reducing defects and variability. Key aspects of Six Sigma include:

1. Goal: Achieve 99.99966% defect-free processes (3.4 defects per million opportunities).

2. DMAIC process: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control - a structured approach to problem-solving.

3. Statistical focus: Heavy emphasis on data analysis and statistical methods.

4. Belt system: Practitioners are classified by skill level (Yellow, Green, Black, Master Black Belts).

5. Customer-centric: Aims to improve quality and meet customer needs.

6. Continuous improvement: Ongoing effort to enhance processes and products.

7. Cost reduction: Aims to lower operational costs by minimizing errors and waste.

Six Sigma was originally developed by Motorola in the 1980s and gained widespread adoption after being implemented by General Electric in the 1990s. It's now used across various industries to improve quality and efficiency.
